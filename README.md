# The Dracula Compiler

**Dracula** is compiler for C, that is also written in The C Programming Language. 
This is learning project designed to learn The C Programming Language and Compiler Theory.

> ðŸ§› For now, itâ€™s more frightening in its name than in its possibilities, 
but work on it is in full swing!

## Project Status 

The compiler is in an early stage of active development. Current Focus:

- [ ] **In Process:** Writting a Lexer.
- [ ] Writting a Parser.

The compiler is not ready for use yet. Stay tuned for updates!
